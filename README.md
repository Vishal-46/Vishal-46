## 🎯 **My Vision for 2025: Passionate Growth and Impact**

By 2025, my goal is to become a proficient **Data Scientist** with a strong foundation in **Machine Learning**, **AI**, and **Data Science**, using my skills to create meaningful and impactful projects.

### **Plan:**
1. **Master Data Science & Machine Learning**:  
   - Build real-world data models using **Python** and libraries like **Pandas**, **Numpy**, and **Scikit-learn**.
   - Deploy interactive data applications with **Streamlit** to make insights accessible and actionable.

2. **Combine Creativity with Technology**:  
   - Continue exploring **Unity** and **Blender** for game development projects, bringing AI-driven concepts to life within immersive environments.
   - Focus on creating interactive, data-powered game experiences that engage users in new and exciting ways.

3. **Inspire & Collaborate**:  
   - Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers to solve real-world problems.
   - Share knowledge through blogs, tutorials, and community engagement, helping others explore the power of data and technology.

I believe that the fusion of **AI** and **game development** can create transformative experiences, and I’m determined to make this my focus moving forward. With each project, I want to challenge myself to innovate, learn, and make an impact that can change the way we interact with technology.
